[Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/doing-bayesian-data/9780124058880/ "The Dog Book") is a nice introductory book to Bayesian analysis. It has examples and exercises in R, which is great. Having computational tools eases our work and therefore instead of always doing things with pen-and-paper, using computers is great.

Instead of using R, I am going to use Mathematica. Below is a Wolfram Notebook, where I explore Chapter 4 and do some exercises. Enjoy!
