On a Sunday morning, having coffee, I recalled the meme saying "remember the days coffee used to have an effect?". Clearly I needed to get that *kick*, not this regular coffee feeling!

[Caffeine Dependence][1] was the obvious problem. I decided to reset the [biochemistry][3] of my body (if only lightly) by not consuming caffeine as long as it would take to get rid of the withdrawal symptoms or at least a week if symptoms go away in, like, a day or two. The thing is, I used to be consciously irregular about coffee consumption to keep my brain on the edge. For example, I would skip a weekend or skip a morning etc. But lately, I have become consistent about when I wake up and study [GEB][2], or write stuff. Which means, I get a cup of coffee at approximately the same time. This went on for more than a month. I was quite sure I had developed stronger dependence.

Having decided to quit caffeine starting Monday, I had a little trouble getting any work done. I had a headache by 11am. Tuesday, I had headache again, but at around 1pm. Wednesday, I got headache at 3pm along with sore muscles - nothing I couldn't manage. And on Thursday, *I was out baby!* I worked the whole day, starting at 7am (oh yeah) and kept going till 11pm. I suppose it took me 4 days to get out of the symptoms. As promised, I am going to avoid caffeine till next Monday. And *then*, I am in for a kick like it was the first day of consuming the drug!

I did nothing special for 3 days, really. I have a habit of drinking something while I read or code. I switched to green tea for such times. As for headaches, well, I believe it is nice to experience mild pain once in a while to remind myself of the pain when I'm healthy. Makes me appreciate normal days more. Also, a headache is a play on the field of consciousness just like thoughts, sounds, vision and can be used to meditate (wink wink, Sam Harris). Since these are COVID days, I was a *little* worried about muscle soreness, but it went away quickly enough.

Anyway, I'll tweet/toot about how I felt on Monday ;)
