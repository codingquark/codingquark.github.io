Why do I have to suffer the wrath of not having a router?

<br />
kiki [16:44] <br />
C'est la vie

<br />
codingquark [16:52] <br />
I was shown the dreams <br />
Of industrial switches <br />
I am given things <br />
Of industrial pains

kiki [16:52] <br />
you will appreciate the past! pain is all about learning!

<br />
codingquark [16:55] <br />
The wrenching heart <br />
The befalling pain <br /> <br />
You take consolation <br />
In learning <br />
In memories <br />
In coming through <br /> <br />
Heart is a Desert of Thorns <br />
And the Thorns do not console.

<br />
kiki [16:57] <br />
Be it a thorn or an axe <br />
The heart is like a tree <br />
The axe forgets <br />
But the tree remembers <br />
The scars and the times

<br />
codingquark [16:58] <br />
The visions of a switch sending packets <br />
The visions of blinking lights <br />
The visions of streams of data <br /> <br />
Oh how I had wished to bathe in the signals of wireless fidelity

:joy:

<br />
kiki [17:02] <br />
Wishing for wireless fidelity and lightning speeds, <br />
you forgot the paths taken to reach here; <br />
you forgot the roots. <br />
Paths filled with the shrills and cries of modems. <br />

<br />
codingquark [17:11] <br />
It takes a beast to enable communications! <br />
The green fiery eyes of the beast must be kept blinking <br />
The true eye must be kept from becoming red <br /> <br />
Many horns of the beast are the key to long range <br />
Many cores of the beast's brain are the key to support many users <br />
The beast must be kept calm and cool, venting heatThe beast has a mood <br /> <br />
When in a bad mood, it disrupts all moods <br />
And the world goes silent. (edited)
