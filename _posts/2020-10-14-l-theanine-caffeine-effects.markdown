Some time ago, a friend discussed his readings on [Nootropic][1]. He came to believe that perhaps there are ways to safely increase cognitive capacities of us humans without much harm. I got interested and asked him to give me a very simple starting point. The point I was given was 200mg [L-theanine][2] + 100mg caffeine tablets.

My initial thoughts were "Boy that's a lot of caffeine! No way!". But the experimenter in me took over. I am going to talk about dosage frequencies and the effects I observed.

**Notes**
1. Never >1 capsule
2. Observe some streaks of no capsules at all for days

### Observations
1. Cognition
   - The distinct "buzz" of caffeine was *not* present
   - Presence of "tunnel vision"
   - Caffeine-related "hyperactive" feeling was absent
   - Effects stayed for ~2 hours
   - Tunnel-vision supported focus was more "manageable" than with only caffeine (coffee)
2. Side effects
   - Between 18th to 30th Sept I caught cold, which I now believe to be due to swimming in bad water
   - Having coffee after a few days of capsules seem to cause a reversal of caffeine tolerance - the coffee hit "hard" as though I was not used to it


### Summary
In my opinion, the effects of caffeine are "improved" by L-theanine. It removes the restlessness, makes the focus smooth and does not seem to be allowing caffeine tolerance to build up (at least very quickly).
