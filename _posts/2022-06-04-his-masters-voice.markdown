I’m simply embedding a Wolfram Notebook here. I haven’t yet figured out how to make it all look consistent and load fast, but here we go for the first round.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/wolfram-notebook-embedder@0.3/dist/wolfram-notebook-embedder.min.js"></script>

<div id="notebookContainer"></div>

<script>

var embedding = WolframNotebookEmbedder.embed('https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/dhavan/Published/playing_with_his_masters_voice.nb', document.getElementById('notebookContainer'));
</script>
