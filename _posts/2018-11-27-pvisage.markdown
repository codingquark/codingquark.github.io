A man

Grown up yet young

Jolly yet depressed

Simple yet complex

Liquid yet broken

<br />
Wears many visages

His interests many yet a visage

His speech fluent yet a visage

His thoughts creative yet a visage

His personality integral yet a visage

<br />
Each morning

Visages are worn

One by one

Each visage... modifying the core

Each visage... a different being

Each visage... an imprint on soul

Each visage... a burden

<br />
Every feeling

Of a beautiful cloud, a visage?

Of a discovery, a visage?

Of calmness, a visage?

Of pain, a visage?

<br />
When feelings are shared with him

A visage takes over

<br />
The expressive

Misunderstood the wit for self

Misunderstood the rigidity for self


Misunderstood the visage for self

Misunderstood self for self

<br />
He lives on

Making more visages

Each time misunderstood

Each time shattered

Each time grateful

Each time less the self.
