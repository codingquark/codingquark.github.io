Hardy says:

>A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities has to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the work which he does is worth doing; and the second is why he does it, whatever its value may be.

I have asked these questions to myself _many_ times. Everytime, I got different answers from the previous ones which is a good sign.
