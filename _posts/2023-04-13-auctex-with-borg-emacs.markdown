Setting up [AUCTeX][1] in [borg][3] requires manual updates in `.gitmodules`.

# Setup
Make sure your $$\TeX$$ installation is functional. Refer to [Prerequisites][4] section of AUCTeX manual

Assimilate auctex:
```text
M-x borg-assimilate <RET> auctex <RET>
```

Ignore the compilation errors for now. Update `.gitmodules`:

```
[submodule "auctex"]
	path = lib/auctex
	url = git@github.com:emacsmirror/auctex.git
	load-path = .
	build-step = ./autogen.sh
	build-step = ./configure --with-lispdir=~/.emacs.d/lib/auctex
	build-step = make
	build-step = make doc
	build-step = borg-maketexi
	build-step = borg-makeinfo
	build-step = borg-update-autoloads
```

Now build AUCTeX again:

```text
M-x borg-build <RET> auctex <RET>
```

We are done, initialization should now be normal:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package tex-site
  :load-path "lib/auctex/")
```

John Wiegly has detailed [configuration][5] if you want something advanced.

# Why?
Borg executes default build steps using the lisp functions `borg-update-autoloads`, `borg-compile`, `borg-maketexi`, and `borg-makeinfo`.

But building AUCTeX requires a few extra steps to build, which we add to `.gitmodules`. For details check `submodule.DRONE.build-step` variable in [the manual][6].
