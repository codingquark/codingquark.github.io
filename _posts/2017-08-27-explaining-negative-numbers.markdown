I wanted to understand complex numbers $$\mathbb{C}$$. I was told, that $$i$$ is
the value of $$\sqrt{-1}$$. I understood why I cannot calculate the root of a
negative number. I thought, to be able to understand imaginary
numbers, I need to understand negative numbers better. And here is the
account of what I thought about negative numbers.

My goal was to see if I can find out a way to show that physical
entities could exist in negative amount.

* There can be 5 pages

* There can be 0 pages (no pages)

* But how can there be -5 pages?

May be, while considering 3 dimensions, things cannot be in
negative. Let's take time into account.

We are in time "now" which is 0sec. We can go forward in time 5sec, we
can go backward in time 5sec. Going forward would mean positive
movement and going backward would mean _negative_ movement. Oh! Did we
really figure it out? Nah, this way, movement in _any_ dimension can
be thought of as being negative and positive.

Let's look around more.

Suppose we are in another universe. After all, mathematics is not
confined in this single, boring universe! In this new universe, we
have an apple lying in front of us. We go backwards in time -1sec,
take the apple. We go -2sec take the apple away, we go -3sec take the
apple away. After this procedure, how many apples are there in "now"?
Of course, there will be -3 apples at time 0 (now), _or will there
be_? The order here is important - first go -1, then -2 and then
-3. If we traveled -3,-2,-1 we could argue that removing the apple
from -3sec will make it disappear from -2 and -1. This might help us
understand existence of things in negative amount, but then we will
have to go through a lot of things to make sure the new universe of
ours is consistent.

Let's look around more.

Initially, we thought of an object going forward and backward in
time. What if we think of time itself, and not of some object? At any
point, time is "now". If we take 1sec away from it, it would become
1 sec less than "now". Do you see how we can go negative here? The
assumption here is that we will have to consider time = 0 at some
point to be able to go in negative realm.

Let's look around more.

We have a standard case that should be looked at. I find it a boring
one, but important one, nonetheless. It is that of accounting. Suppose
I get 1 apple a day. I have 5 apples right now. Someone asks for 6
apples in 2 batches of 3 apples/batch. Surely, I can give them 6
apples if I spread the batches over the period of 2 days. So I accept
the deal. How many apples do I now have? Yes, -1. I think this is just
for convenience that we thought of apples being negative. We don't
have -1 amount of actual physical apples. It is an abstract way of
thinking about amounts.

If you observe, in all the cases we examined so far, our calculations
have been relative. We took the point of origin to be 0 and then
traveled on the number line. May be it is not possible for physical
entities to be in negative existence, but when we look at things
relatively, negative entities can exist - or at least, we can think of
them as being in negative amount.

It seems, that we would not be able to progress anywhere unless we
think of things as being in negative amount because relativity is how
the universe operates.

I now feel equipped enough to embark on a study of complex
numbers. A post on that will be coming in future.
