My name is Dhavan, and you are reading my blog.

I like tinkering with software, various hardware, lisps, sci-fi novels, mathematics, music and such things. Checkout some of my posts to get an idea. I also like writing. I value independence and freedom including freedom of computing.

On normal days you may find me tinkering with some theoretical study, machine learning, electronics projects, programming projects and mostly just fixing things here and there. Professionally, I run a business.

You can find me on

Please drop me an email (itâ€™s at the bottom of all pages in the footer) to talk! If email is not your thing, mastodon is another option.
