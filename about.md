My name is Dhavan, and you are reading my [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog).

I like tinkering with [Emacs](https://github.com/codingquark/emacs.g), various hardware, lisps, sci-fi novels, mathematics, music and such things. Checkout some of my posts to get an idea. I also like writing. I value independence and freedom including freedom of computing.

On normal days you may find me tinkering with some theoretical study, machine learning, electronics projects, programming projects and mostly just fixing things here and there. Professionally, I run a business.

You can find me on

mastodon: [https://mathstodon.xyz/@codingquark](https://mathstodon.xyz/@codingquark)

Libera.Chat: as `codingquark` usually on `#emacs`

Goodreads: [https://goodreads.com/codingquark](https://goodreads.com/codingquark)

My code is mainly at: [https://github.com/codingquark](https://github.com/codingquark) & [https://gitlab.com/codingquark](https://gitlab.com/codingquark)

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/@codingquark), but I don’t really use it much. You will not find me on most other “platforms”, I don’t like them for many reasons. Please drop me an email (it’s at the bottom of all pages in the footer) to talk! If email is not your thing, mastodon is another option.
